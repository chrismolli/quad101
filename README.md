# quad101
Very early stage of our planned Quadcopter project, which is to be realised by using
the Arduino 101 with Intel's Curie Module as the main flight controller.

Right now, we are working on the implementation of positional controll with a PID controller and
different sensor sources (Gyro,Accelerometer,Magnetometer).

The main goal is the process of learning and not really the final product. If we can however accomplish to build
a good working prototype, we will consider making a usable quadcopter from it.
