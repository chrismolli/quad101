# quad101
Very early stage of our planned quadcopter project, which is to be realized by using
the Arduino 101 with its builtin Intel's Curie Module as the main flight controller.

Right now, we are working on the implementation of positional control with a PID controller and
different sensor sources (Onboard gyro and accelerometer+ 3axis-magnetometer).

The main goal is the process of learning and not really the final product. If we can however accomplish to build
a good working prototype, we will consider making a usable quadcopter from it.
